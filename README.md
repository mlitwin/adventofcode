# Advent of Code

A group of us at [McGraw Hill](https://www.mheducation.com/about.html) have been doing the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), so I thought I'd give it a try.

[2021](adventofcode.com/2021/) is my first time in.

Doing it in JavaScript. Maybe once I get the hang of how the puzzles work I'll try to branch out and use a different language. Golang, or maybe just TypeScript.

Notes:
* The code is pretty raw - "just needs to run once". Given the time available, I've not gone back and cleaned up.
* ToDo: Understand / re-implement priority queues (ones where you can change priority too - "open")
* ToDo: Implement A+, A*
* ToDo: Round out and clean up Matrix class. E.g. needs an inverse.
* ToDo: Maybe a "M" math namespace for all the utilities.
