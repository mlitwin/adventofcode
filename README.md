# Advent of Code

A group of us at [McGraw Hill](https://www.mheducation.com/about.html) have been doing the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), so I thought I'd give it a try.

[2021](adventofcode.com/2021/) is my first time in.

Doing it in JavaScript. Maybe once I get the hang of how the puzzles work I'll try to branch out and use a different language. Golang, or maybe just TypeScript.
