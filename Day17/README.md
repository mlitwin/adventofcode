The probe's x,y position starts at 0,0. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in steps. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:

The probe's x position increases by its x velocity.
The probe's y position increases by its y velocity.
Due to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.
Due to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.


x = n * vx - (n-1)n/2
y = n * vy + (n-1)/2
